## Excercises from Swing, JavaFX, Hibernate made on studies - 2nd year

Base uderstaning of GUI project.  

JavaFX views are made with Scene Builder.   

Hibernate is configured manually (taken from example config) - for whole experience check ParkoMania repo.  

Swing is mental state, simple yet quite not intuitive. I liked JavaFX much better.
